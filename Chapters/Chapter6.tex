\section{Identifying right criteria for ranking blends}

\subsection{Speciality}
We first started by blending musical instruments without any ranking parameters. The blending suggestions we got, were of varying quality. We recognized that the best suggestions were the ones that were most specific, such as the ones that were found due to being in the category device or artifact. Therefore we introduced two criteria to give a higher score to more specific suggestions. The first was to give a positive score based on the depth of the shared hypernym of the blending suggestion and its correlating properties in the other instrument. For example if we blend \emph{Piano} and \emph{Hurdy Gurdy} (seen in Figure~\ref{fig:hurdy-gurdy}), it gave a high score to the suggestion of transferring the \emph{piano chamber} over, since the Hurdy Gurdy also has a \emph{bodily cavity} which is the hypernym of chamber. The bodily cavity had a depth score of 7, which tells us that it is far from being general.

The other criteria we introduced was a score negatively proportional to the branch length. From piano chamber, it is only one hypernym up to bodily cavity. This is good because it means that the suggestions are close to each other in speciality. Therefore the score given by the branch length criteria was only -1. The suggestion to was then given the total score of 7 minus 1, which is 6. The properties used in the calculation is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:piano-hurdy-gurdy}.

	\label{fig:piano-hurdy-gurdy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Category penalty}
We observed that a lot of suggestions were not useful so we took note of the categories bad blends shared. Different instruments were often mentioned in the abstracts, which were then interpreted as properties. It does not make sense to transfer whole instruments to other instruments. It would be too invasive since concept blending are more about blending parts of concepts, not adding whole concepts to other concepts. Therefore we introduced a penalty score for the category \emph{instruments}. Later we also decided to remove properties of the category instruments altogether since they would still form correlations with other devices, since device is one of the hypernyms of instrument.

We also observed that properties of the category \emph{individuals} were not useful as well, since they were typically people like the inventor of the instrument or a famous musician using this instrument. It does not make sense to blend the people involved, since they are not parts or properties of the instrument. What use would there be to transfer an inventor over to an instrument they have not invented?

We initially thought that abstract entities was a bad category to blend, since good blending examples are typically physical entities. But on further inspection, we found that some of these entities were useful, like shapes and other attributes. Instead, we penalized certain abstract entities that we were more certain being bad categories. \emph{Psychological feature} are probably not interesting if they most likely are part of something other than the instrument, since instruments does not have a psychological quality. We also penalized \emph{communication}, since we are not interested in the message, language or style expressed by the instrument. This is usually a matter of choice from the musician and not the instrument. Although some instruments are typical for a certain style, we do not want to define the style of new instrument in advance of its use. \emph{Body parts} are not something we want to blend as parts, but in future approaches that look for relations, this would be useful to describe relations like \emph{plucked by fingers}.

\subsection{Number of correlating properties}
We observed that in some cases the top blending suggestions got an equal score. Could we find a difference in quality between these? We introduced another parameter, the number of correlating properties in the other concept. If the other concept has a lot of properties in the same shared category as the blending suggestion, this may tell us that the property is more compatible than the one with few correlations. The property may fit with the other concept in more than one way.

\subsection{Introducing factors for each parameter}
We realized that a factor of one for each parameter may not be yield the best results. Therefore we introduced a factor for each parameter so that they could be tweaked to push blends of higher quality to the top. Then we could find an optimal range of values for pushing the best suggestions to the top.

\subsection{Other potential criteria}
We thought of other possible parameters that could be used, that we did not implement and evaluate:
\begin{itemize}
\item The branch lengths of the correlating properties could be counted or averaged to give an indication of their speciality.
\item The difference between the branch lengths of the suggested property and its correlating properties could give an indication of compatibility. For example we may not want to blend a property with a branch length of 5 when the correlating properties are very general in comparison, like if it has a length of 1. Blending \emph{game equipment} like the special chess piece \emph{rook} just because the other concept had a more general game equipment like \emph{game board}, may not be as good as if it were type of board with similar level of specificity like \emph{backgammon board}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Blending musical instruments}


Here are a couple of blending examples when using the application to blend musical instruments. We have blended a wide variety of instruments to give us an indication of how the algorithm perform in different scenarios. First we present the blending suggestions when we use an unaltered abstract as it was retrieved directly from Wikipedia. Then we try again, but this time using an improved abstract we created manually by removing unhelpful sentences and adding new useful facts. If synsets were wrong, we also manually corrected them. This way we can evaluate the second and third step of the application in an optimal environment.

\subsection{Blending Banjo and Melodica}

\subsubsection{Unaltered abstract}

Banjo properties:

\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
		
		five membrane frame resonator called head animal skin circular forms africans animal skin
		
	} }
\\\\Melodica properties:

\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
		
		key pump keyboard top played blowing mouthpiece fits hole side pressing reed popular asia modern form italy century
		
	} }
\\\\Top blending suggestion was to move the word \emph{five} from banjo to melodica with the score of 4, correlating with the property \emph{century} through the common category \emph{integer}. \emph{Century} is a part of the cultural description of melodica, rather than the more useful sentences describing physical attributes.

\subsubsection{Optimal environment}
By improving the banjo abstract we got more relevant properties like \emph{strings} and \emph{frets}, and a variety of materials which the banjo parts and strings are made of.
\\Improved banjo properties:\\
\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{

} }	
\\\\In the new set of melodica properties we got rid of cultural words like \emph{Asia}, \emph{Italy} and \emph{century}, and retrieved more relevant ones like the materials \emph{plastic} and \emph{wood}.
\\Improved melodica properties:\\
\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
			
	keyboard top played blowing air mouthpiece fits hole pressing key flow reed two three light portable majority plastic wood
			
} }
\\\\The top blending suggestion we got was introducing \emph{machine} as in the guitar's worm gear machine head for tuning the strings (see Figure~\ref{fig:worm-gear}). It correlated with the \emph{reed} of melodica, through the category \emph{mechanical device}. It is more specific than the other categories, but still so general that they are not closely related in function. Although we found the noun phrase \emph{machine head}, it did not exist in WordNet, giving us a indication of the limits of its database. The user may be inspired to create a melodica where you can tune the reeds with a similar tuning device as guitar.

The calculation of this blending suggestion is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:Banjo-Melodica2}.

\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
			
	wooden string family scroll neck fingerboard bridge sound hole tailpiece four strings tuned commonly played drawing bow plucking called wood strung gut synthetic steel sound hole
			
} }
\\\\We got two top blending suggestions with the score 5. The first was to blend the violin \emph{bow} with harp, correlating through the category \emph{implement} with the harp \emph{pedals} that bend the strings. Harpists have played harps with bows, but since you have to insert the bow between harp strings, it is not easy to change notes. However since the harpists have two available hands, they can use two bows. The calculation is visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:Harp-ViolinOptimal}.

The other top suggestion was to move the \emph{bridge} from violin to harp, correlating with \emph{levers} through the category \emph{device}. Not a very interesting addition, since harp strings is mounted in a way that transmit enough vibration to the soundboard already.

The top suggestion to move from harp to violin was \emph{pedals} which modify pitch, correlating with the violin \emph{bow} through the category \emph{implement}. This could be an interesting feature, but since the violin has no frets, modifying pitch is already possible with the glissando technique where you slide fingers up or down the string. However if you want to play lower than the open string or bend further than the fingers can reach (unlikely on a small violin), a pedal could be useful.

\subsection{Blending Cello and Oboe}

\subsubsection{Unaltered abstract}

Cello properties:

\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{

\\\\Oboe properties:


\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{

\\\\This blend was, as indicated by its low score, quite general (see Figure~\ref{Cello-Oboe}). The blending suggestion could have been any artifact on the oboe. It is not easy to imagine how a flared bell could fit on a cello without further elaboration. Perhaps the body could be given this shape and resonate in an interesting way. But since air is not blown through the body of a cello like a wind instrument, it might not have the same effect on the timbre as on an oboe. But there exists a type of drums called Staccato drums which have a notched horn shape to change its sound quality and volume.

Dobro properties:\\

\\\\We started with the unaltered abstract.
With these properties we got similar blending suggestions from both Dobro and Harp. It suggested to move \emph{body}, the cavity resonator, from dobro to the harp, while it also suggested to move the soundboard, which is also a cavity resonator, from harp to dobro. Being both types of cavity resonator, they got the same score. Although a dobro has a body, this word came from a reference to a solid body guitar, which is not the same. Other suggestions were not nearly as good in terms of score, moving steel from dobro to harp got as score of 1, but it was the wrong synset. Not the material but a sharpener. Manually improving the WSD did not improve the suggestions and scores significantly.

\subsubsection{Optimal environment}

After improving the abstracts by manually selecting useful parts from the Wikipedia abstract, we got a somewhat different result. Body was no longer a property, but soundboard from harp was still the best suggestion since dobro had a cavity resonator, which is its hypernym. The best suggestion of dobro was aluminium from its cast aluminium spider, linking with the metal that strings may be made of in a harp. Other suggestions that were less rewarded, but more interesting would have been the cone or bowl forming the resonator. An interesting but low scoring suggestion from harp is its pitch bending levers or pedals.

There were a lot of blending suggestions from guitar to violin that shared the top score of 6, and also one from violin to guitar. All of them had a depth of 7 and branch length of 1. It suggested to move the number \emph{six} as in six strings from guitar due to a correlation with the number \emph{four} in violin. And four strings were naturally suggested to move to guitar as well. These examples have been already been produced, although four string guitars are not very popular and six string violins are not practical to play. Like the unaltered abstract, moving pick from guitar to violin was also the top suggestion, but this time it got a higher score because it correlated with the property \emph{bridge} through the more specific hypernym \emph{device}. Although correlating with a bow would be more interesting, since pick and bow are both used to vibrate a string. This is another indication that using relations in the algorithm would give more meaningful correlations, since it would be useful to find other properties that are able to vibrate or do something more general to the string.

Another top blending suggestion was to move a \emph{rod}, as in the guitars truss rod, over to violin. It correlated with the violin \emph{bow} since they are both implements. A truss rod is a steel bar inside the guitar neck, that keeps the thin neck from curving due to the tension of the strings. Therefore it is not closely related to a bow, but making a violin with a truss rod could be useful if we wanted to make the neck thinner or use string materials of higher tension than a normal neck would withstand. %Other top blending suggestions were to move \emph{gut}, as in a string made of gut, from guitar to violin. It correlated with the word \emph{string} in violin since they are both of the category cords. This could be an interesting thing to blend, although  %TODO

Interesting suggestions that have lower score include moving frets from guitar, but it forms a less interesting correlation with \emph{bow} through the hypernym implement. It would be desirable if the fretboard of guitar formed a correlation with the fingerboard of violin, but fretboard is not recognized by WordNet, although fingerboard is. The hypernym of fingerboard is \emph{strip}, defined as a thin piece of wood or metal. Fingerboard could form interesting suggestions by blending violin with certain objects since people have been mounting strings on shovels and other such thin pieces of wood or metal. However the \emph{bar} of a shovel is considered by WordNet as an instrumentality while \emph{strip} is considered a building material, meaning they are separated too generally to achieve a good score. This is another example of how it is hard to use WordNet to find close relations by comparing only single synsets.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section{Alternative blending category}
\subsection{Sports}
The algorithm was tested on the alternative blending category sports. The context words to help the scoring of synsets were:

\noindent\fbox{
	\parbox{\textwidth}{
		sport athletic ball field team goal rules foul score player referee match racket club net skates skis helmet pads bat pitch court tee green win draw loss
	}
}
\\\\The penalized category was 'athletic game', as we would not want sports to be suggested, since it is the category itself.

\subsection{Blending Soccer and Golf }

\subsubsection{Unaltered abstract}

Soccer properties:

\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
	
	association football commonly soccer team played two eleven players spherical ball million dependencies world game field goal object score getting opposing allowed hands arms team sport extra time World Cups
	
} }
\\\\Golf properties:
	
\noindent\fbox{ \parbox{\textwidth}{
	
	golf club ball players various hit series holes course strokes unlike games standardized playing terrains key level played arranged progression playing area putting green sand traps
			
} }
\\\\When performing the algorithm on \emph{soccer} and \emph{golf}, it suggested to move \emph{goal} from \emph{soccer} to \emph{golf}, with a depth of 8 minus branch length 1, giving a score of 7 (see Figure~\ref{fig:SoccerToGolf}). The definition of goal is \emph{game equipment consisting of the place toward which players of a game try to advance a ball or puck in order to score points}. This is interesting because the same thing can be said about the \emph{hole} in golf generally. The definition of \emph{hole} in golf by this synset definition is \emph{one playing period (from tee to green) on a golf course} which is about the round of play, not the physical hole.


It also suggested to move \emph{terrains} from \emph{golf} to \emph{soccer}, with a depth of 7 minus branch length 1, giving a score of 6 (see Figure~\ref{fig:GolfToSoccer}).
Playing soccer on uneven terrain is also an interesting idea (see Figure~\ref{fig:SoccerTerrain}) that is not common but would be possible to organize, although it may not be an evenly balanced game. One reason for why the interpretations of these suggestions worked well may be because the relations to the other elements in the concept did not contradict. \emph{Terrains} in golf matched with the part \emph{field} in soccer through their common hypernym \emph{parcel}. By not going further up the generalizing chain, the more likely the relations still work.
