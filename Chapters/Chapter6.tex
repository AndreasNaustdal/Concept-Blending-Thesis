\section{Alternative blending category}
\subsection{Sports}
The algorithm was tested on the alternative blending category sports. The context words to help the scoring of synsets were: 'sport', 'athletic', 'ball', 'field', 'team', 'goal', 'rules', 'foul', 'score', 'player', 'referee', 'match', 'racket', 'club', 'net', 'skates', 'skis', 'helmet', 'pads', 'bat', 'pitch', 'court', 'tee', 'green', 'win', 'draw' and 'loss'.
The penalized category was 'athletic game', as we would not want sports to be suggested, since it is the category itself.
