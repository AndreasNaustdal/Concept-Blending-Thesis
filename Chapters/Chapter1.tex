\section{Motivation/Background}
Combining two concepts into a new concept that combines elements from each original concept is something humans can do rather easily. If we think of blending a horse and a bird, we can easily imagine a winged horse like the mythological Pegasus. Or when blending a car with a boat we can think of an amphibian boat. Formalizing the task of concept blending is not as straightforward. The problem consists of retrieving input data, selecting which parts of the data that should be blended and handling contradictory elements in the final blend.
The goal of this master thesis is to implement a concept blending algorithm and generate new concepts by blending existing concepts retrieved from a public data source such as Wikipedia/DBpedia, and using NLP tools like WordNet to prepare the input data. Although the concept blending algorithm may be used on any concept, I will choose from concepts that are musical instruments to focus on a target group of musicians. Further the generated instruments will be evaluated about how useful they are in a musical context. The goal is to find out whether this approach can produce new instruments that make sense and find out how they might innovate the profession of musicians.

\section{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can a concept blending algorithm generate musical instruments that are reasonable and useful?
\item What are optimal solutions for preparing input data and perform contradiction detection, in the context of using the concept blending algorithm to generate musical instruments?
\end{itemize}
The motivation for these questions is to uncover new knowledge on what the concept blending algorithm can be used for, how it can be used successfully and how it compares to other approaches.
